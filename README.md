# HatDetector
a very simple script that determines whether a person has a hat on his head or not.

# Note

This program was trained on a dataset of people who have already been wearing a hat, so it will correctly detect hats that are worn by people. I also emphasized speed over accuracy by using the YOLOv8n model trained on custom data from OpenImages.
